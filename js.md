## Primitive Type
* Primitive Data Types: A primitive data type is pre-defined by the programming language. The size and type of variable values are specified, and it has no additional methods. 
*  Primitive values are immutable.
* Primitives are stored by value.
## Number 
* number datatype in javascript can hold the decimal values as well as non decimal values.
* Possible Values : -1 | 3 | 3.42 | 9.66e | Infinity | - Infinity | NaN


## String 
* A string is a sequence of one or more characters that may consist of letters, numbers, or symbols.
* Possible Values : "text" | 'text' | `text` | `javascript is "brain" of html`

## Boolean 
* JavaScript has a Boolean data type. It can only take the values true or false.
* Possible Values : true | false

## Null
* The value null represents the intentional absence of any object value.
* This datatype can only hold the possible values that is null
* typeof(boolean) : "object"

## undefined
* Undefined is a type of its own. It’s not an object. 
* Just a value JavaScript will use when you named a variable but don’t assign a value to it. Your hoisted variables will also be automatically assigned a value of undefined.
* typeof(boolean) : "undefined"  

## Symbol
* Symbols are completely unique identifiers. Just like their primitive counterparts (Number, String, Boolean), they can be created using the factory function Symbol() which returns a Symbol.
* Syntax  : const symbol = Symbol('description');



## Non Primitive type 
* Non-Primitive Data Types: These data types are not actually defined by the programming language but are created by the programmer.
* Non-primitive values are mutable.
* Non-Primitive (objects) are stored by reference.

## Object 
* JavaScript objects are written with curly braces {}.
* Object properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas
